How to compile my program

Use "g++ questionB.cpp" command.
Then use "g++ -o questionB questionB.cop
Then use "./questionB " command.
Then the result will come out.



This is about Lab1,Question B.
It is about Writing a C++ program to read in an integer and print out the corresponding sequence of numbers.

Now, I would talk about how to compile my program for question B. 

Since we want to do something different when the integer is odd and even,
so I use if else statement to make the condition different.

Since we want to repeat the if else statement,
so I use do while statement to make it repeat.
